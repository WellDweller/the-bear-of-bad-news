Our entry for [Ludum Dare 53](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53/the-bear-of-bad-news).

You are a bear doctor **delivering** bad news in a hospital.  Bears aren't great at English, but you'll have to do your best anyway.  You'll encounter a number of minigames on your way.  Pass them and you'll give respectful, professional answers to the friends and family of patients; fail them, and you might say something you regret.

Includes 8 songs.  Can you find them all?

**Play the game [here](https://welldweller.github.io/machine-yearning/).**

## Minigame Instructions

The minigames can be interacted with either by pressing enter or space on a keyboard or clicking with the mouse.
